| **Aspect**                     | **Abstract Class**                                       | **Interface**                                           |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                    | To define a common base for related classes with shared state and behavior. | To define a contract or capability without dictating how itâ€™s implemented. |
| **Inheritance**                | Single inheritance only.                                 | Multiple inheritance allowed.                          |
| **Methods**                    | Can have abstract and full range of concrete methods.                 | Can have abstract, default (Java 8+), static (Java 8+), and private (Java 9+) methods. |
| **Methods Without Explicit Modifier** | Package-private (default access level).               | Implicitly `public`.                                   |
| **Variables Without Explicit Modifier** | Package-private (default access level).               | Implicitly `public static final`.                      |
| **Package-Private Members**    | Allowed (methods, variables, and constructors).          | Not allowed; all members are either `public` or `private` (methods from Java 9+). |
| **Default Methods**            | Not applicable (only concrete methods allowed).          | Introduced in Java 8: Provide default implementation for methods. Requires explicit conflict resolution for ambiguity. |
| **Static Methods**             | Cannot access instance variables directly; can only operate on static members of the class. | Cannot access instance variables; can only operate on static members of the interface. |
| **Private Methods**            | Allowed, can be used to encapsulate helper logic.        | Introduced in Java 9: Used as helper methods for default or static methods. Cannot be accessed outside the interface. |
| **Variable Modifiers**         | Can define instance variables with any access modifier (`private`, `protected`, `public`). | Variables are implicitly `public static final`. No other modifier is allowed. |
| **Memeber classes and interfaces**         |Full range of modifiers. | Implicitly `public static`. No other modifier is allowed. |
| **Constructors**               | Can define constructors to initialize state.            | Cannot have constructors.                              |
| **Access Modifiers for Methods**| Abstract and concrete methods can have any access modifier (`public`, `protected`, `private`, package-private). | Methods are implicitly `public` (abstract, default, and static). Private methods are `private` (Java 9+). |
| **Extensibility**              | A class can only extend one abstract class.              | A class can implement multiple interfaces.             |
| **State Sharing**              | Can share state (fields) among subclasses.              | Cannot share state; focuses on behavior only.          |
| **Performance**                | Method calls are resolved via the **vtable** (virtual table), which is faster. | Abstract methods use **itable** (interface table), which has slightly more overhead. Default methods use **vtable**. |
| **Method Resolution**          | Straightforward inheritance due to single class hierarchy. | Requires explicit resolution in case of default method conflicts using `InterfaceName.super.methodName()`. |
| **Synchronization**            | Supports synchronization on instance and static methods declarations. | method definitions cannot include synchronization (even static ones). Conceptually synchronization is not part of the contract |
| **Ambiguity (Diamond Problem)**| No ambiguity due to single inheritance.                 | Requires explicit conflict resolution for conflicting default methods. |
| **Evolution**                  | Stable since early Java versions.                       | Enhanced in Java 8+ with default, static, and private methods. |
| **Examples**                   | Base class for vehicles, animals, or templates.         | Capability like `Comparable`, `Runnable`, or `Flyable`. |
